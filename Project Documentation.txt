   - Execute the provided SQL script (`quizzasac.sql`) to set up the necessary tables and data.

3. Configure Database Connection:
   - Navigate to the `JDBC.java` file located in the `src/database` directory.
   - Update the following constants with your MySQL credentials:
     ```java
     private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/quizzasac_gui_db";
     private static final String DB_USERNAME = "your_username";
     private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your_password";
     ```

4. Compile and Run the Application:
   - Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   - Import the project.
   - Build and execute the `Main.java` file located in the `src` directory.

 Usage

- Taking a Quiz:
  - Launch the application.
  - Select a subject from the available options.
  - Answer the questions presented.
  - Submit your answers to receive your score.

- Creating a New Quiz:
  - Access the 'Create Quiz' section.
  - Enter the quiz title and select the subject category.
  - Add questions along with multiple-choice answers, specifying the correct one.
  - Save the quiz to make it available for others.

 Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with the following primary tables:

- CATEGORY:
  - `category_id` (Primary Key)
  - `category_name`

- QUESTION:
  - `question_id` (Primary Key)
  - `category_id` (Foreign Key referencing `CATEGORY`)
  - `question_text`

- ANSWER:
  - `answer_id` (Primary Key)
  - `question_id` (Foreign Key referencing `QUESTION`)
  - `answer_text`
  - `is_correct` (Boolean indicating if the answer is correct)

Ensure that foreign key constraints are appropriately set to maintain referential integrity.
